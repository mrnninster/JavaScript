# FUNCTIONS

In this section we are working with functions. A function like the name implies is a specific set of code that varried out a specified task. An everyday example is cooking.

You prepare you ingredients give it to the function, the function make your spaghetti following each step you have defined and it comes out exactly how you like it.

We define a function by using the keyword "function" after which we name it, and define the contents of the function as shown in the "index.js" file.

We can then go ahead to call or invoke the function when we want to use it.

Something really important to take notice of is "SCOPING", simply put this is the region of code where variables and sometimes function that have been defined are available
for access by other items in your code.

A variable defined inside a function can only be used inside that function and is called a function variable, this variablle has a functionscope since it cannot be used outside that function.

A variable defined outside any function is called a global variables and has a global scope, meaning it can be accessed anywhere in the script.

A function can also take in parameters this is the reason we put parenthesis beside the name of a function, think of these as the putting cooking ingredients in the cooking pot with the cooking methods as the steps of the function.(Auto Cook)
