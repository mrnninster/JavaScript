# Practical application of JS

We developed a rock-paper-scissors game in this project

## What we used

- Variables
- Operators
- Functions
- Event Listeners
- Callbacks
- If/Else Statements

## What I learnt

- The most important one would be Dom Manipulation.

Well, a lot this was my first js project considering I really have a strong dislike for JS, I could se the similarities withlanguages like PHP and PYTHON and I guess that's why I could pick it up easily and I can say I can integrate the languages i know with js fairly easily now.
