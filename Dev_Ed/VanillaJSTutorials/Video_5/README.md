# IF STATEMENTS

If statements act as filter to determine action to be performed based on specified conditions. For example a customer should only have the option to
checkout if there is an item in their cart. Another example is how we check if a viewer is of appropriate age for a
viewing content.

Some conditions check for are equality

- > Greater Than
- < Less Than
- > = Greater Than or Equal To
- <= Less Than or Equal To
- === Equals to

Conditions can also be combined using the "&&" symbol, you do a check for a false condition using the "!" symbol.
you can also check if one of multiple conditions are true using the "||" symbol.
