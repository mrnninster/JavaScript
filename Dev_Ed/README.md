# This is the section from the video series of Dev_Ed on Youtube

This section follows his tutorial videos on javascript and can be watched through this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nZiB1JItbY&list=PLDyQo7g0_nsX8_gZAB8KD1lL4j4halQBJ). I find that he's tutorials enjoyable and i think this will help you follow the class step by step. Not getting paid for doing this or anything well for learning i guess, anyways enjoy.
