## PART 2 VARIABLES AND DATATYPES

This is how you make a comment "//"
Strings, Integers, Booleans, null and undefined will be covered
Variables are a means of storing value, think of it like a shopping basket you can create for anything
We assign variables using the "=" sign as you will see in this script
The old way or creating variables uses the keyword "var" as you will see and the new way use the keywords "let" and "const"

- const stands for constant and means the variable content will not be changes
- let allows you change the content of the variable
- Both "let" and "const" would not not allows you re declare a variables, so variables can only be declared once however "var" does allow this
